# 100DaysOfCode
The repository contains code snippets for the problem statements provided as part of *100 days of code* initiative.
Please do not fork or modify unless you are participating.

---

As part of the new year, we could try this initiative - where you can accomplish small coding tasks for 100 days straight. You are free to choose any language you like (preferably a new language so you can gain new skills). There are **no** restrictions to your choice of IDE, compiler or language.

## General Rules
- Everyday, a new coding challenge shall be posted in the respective day-numbered folder. Create a branch from the repository and and workout the requirement
- Once the coding is done, merge back to the **master** branch. The changes shall be reviewed before merging.
- A challenge would typically use up 30-45 minutes of time
- Learning/Experimenting would not account in the stipulated time specified.
- No skips allowed - participants shall not skip a single day of coding. Persistence is the key.
- References can be taken from anywhere. Even answers might be available on the web. **It is okay to use them, provided you learn how it works / you know where to fix the code.** 
- There's no winning - you fulfill a day's task once you are able to generate the output.
- A sandbox application shall be provided everyday, where an application will test your code with certain usecases. You can view the execution time and the correctness of the algorithm.


## FAQ
> Can I work on this outside of the organization?

Yes, this repository is public and can be accessed from anywhere in the web. Please make sure you do not commit any confidential contents.

> What if, due to unforeseen reasons, I am unable to code for the day?

It's alright, skip a day. But make sure to compensate within the next day. If you know you're going to skip a few days, attempt to complete tasks before hand. Tasks will be present inside 5 folders from the current day's folder.

> Can I write in multiple languages?

Yes! It wil increase your comprehensiveness across languages. It also helps you to attain language-neutrality, meaning - you will think more algorithm-oriented and worry less about the language with which you're going to code.

> What do you mean that there's no winning?

The initiative is merely a support to help you learn a new language. The main intention is to develop a software-culture across the team, along with a competency development with modern frameworks and tools. Maybe, few contests can be held - say fastest code or least complex code shall win. But will be done for only few days. Competitive everyday is tiring, meh.

> Do you know any IDEs/Compilers for the language x/y?

Here's a list of languages intended and their respective popular-compilers:

| Language      | IDE                             | Source  |
|:------------- |:-------------                   |:-----|
| C/C++         | GCC, MinGW, TurboC              | First 2 in SCCM, TurboC available ext-organization |
| Java          | Eclipse, ECU.Worx, IntelliJ     |   First 2 in SCCM, IntelliJ available ext-organization |
| Perl          | ActiveState/Strawberry Perl     | All available in SCCM  |
| Python        | Python Shell 2.7/3.6, Anaconda, PyCharm | First 2 in SCCM, PyCharm available ext-organization |
| C#            | MSBuild+Notepad++, Visual Studio, Mono | MSBuild packaged with Windows, rest available ext-organization |
| JS            | Chrome/Firefox, Node.JS         | Node.JS available ext-organization  |

> What do I get by doing this?

Inner peace first, but more importantly you will get to refresh your algo skills. This will help you to maintain persistent thinking, and future-readiness. You can achieve better software understanding and the way our software works.

> Where can I get help?

Raise a issue in the repository and it will be responded within a day or two at the maximum.


### The program will begin Jan 15 '20. Good luck and enjoy coding, you can do it!
